Final project for CS231N - Classifying Roadways Using Satellite Imagery in Metro Detroit

This repository contains the data and code supporting my team's final project for Stanford's CS231N course. 
Our project involves classifying images of roads in Metro Detroit based on the number of lanes in the road
and road quality.
